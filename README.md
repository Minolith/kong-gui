# Minolith Kong API GUI
A beautiful and useful gui to the Kong API (https://getkong.org)

Kong is a scalable, open source API Layer *(also known as an API Gateway, or
API Middleware)*. Kong was originally built at [Mashape][https://www.mashape.com/] to
secure, manage and extend over
[15,000 Microservices](http://stackshare.io/mashape/how-mashape-manages-over-15000-apis-and-microservices)
for its API Marketplace, which generates billions of requests per month.

Backed by the battle-tested **NGINX** with a focus on high performance, Kong
was made available as an open-source platform in 2015. Under active
development, Kong is now used in production at hundreds of organizations from
startups, to large enterprises and government departments including: The New
York Times, Expedia, Healthcare.gov, The Guardian, Condè Nast and The
University of Auckland.

## Summary
